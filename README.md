# challenge-3-password-generator

## Description

- What was your motivation?
The motivation behind the project was to get a working password generator based on the users preferred criteria.

- Why did you build this project?
The project was built to gain a better understanding of JavaScript code and logical thinking to get the desired result.

- What problem does it solve?
The problem being solved is allowing a user to generate a random password based on the desired length, and whether to include uppercase and/or lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers.

- What did you learn?
I learned how to utilize alerts, prompts and confirms to store user choices for a desired password length to generate a random result when clicking on a button.

## Usage

Users press the generate password button and enter a valid length between 8 and 128. They then click OK to include or cancel to exclude uppercase and/or lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers.

Depending on the chosen criteria, the generator will then display the random password on the page.
